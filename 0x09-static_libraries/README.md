This directory contains, the source files(.c) and object files
of many function, that have been user defined and created.
To ace this task, only the archive/static library(libmy.a) and the main.h file are required to be pushed to git.
However, I have pushed along side with them all the source files and the object codes generated by using the gcc command -c.

a static library can be created with ar rc libstatic.a object.o to be added to library.
Thank you, thank God.
Always remember,
	   the cause endures,
	   the hope still lives,
	   the dream shall never die.
	   Shalom.
